            <p>The Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican, or simply Saint Peter's Basilica,
                 is a church built in the Renaissance style located in Vatican City, the papal 
                 enclave that is within the city of Rome. It was initially planned by Pope Nicholas V 
                 and then Pope Julius II to replace the aging Old St. Peter's Basilica, which was 
                 built in the 4th century by Roman emperor Constantine the Great. 
                 Construction of the present basilica began on 18 April 1506 and was completed 
                 on 18 November 1626. St. Peter's is famous as a place of pilgrimage and for its
                  liturgical functions. The pope presides at a number of liturgies throughout 
                  the year both within the basilica or the adjoining St. Peter's Square; 
                  these liturgies draw audiences numbering from 15,000 to over 80,000 people.
                   St. Peter's has many historical associations, with the Early Christian Church,
                    the Papacy, the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-reformation 
                    and numerous artists, especially Michelangelo. As a work of architecture, 
                    it is regarded as the greatest building of its age. St. Peter's is one of the
                     four churches in the world that hold the rank of Major papal basilica, 
                     all four of which are in Rome, and is also one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches
                      of Rome. Contrary to popular misconception, it is not a cathedral because 
                      it is not the seat of a bishop; the cathedra of the pope as Bishop of Rome 
                      is at Saint John Lateran.
