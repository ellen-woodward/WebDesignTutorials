            <p>The dictionary version of leadership is “to lead a group of people or an organization.” 
                But it’s not as simple as that. Leaders throughout every rung of the organization ladder 
                are integral to the overall success of the business. Effective leadership is about executing 
                the company’s vision (or redefining and improving it, in some cases) and setting the tone and 
                the culture for that particular organization. Leadership means creating and planning, securing resources, 
                and looking out for and improving errors. Leadership is about motivating people to work together and 
                cooperate with themselves and in some cases, other teams, to achieve a certain goal.
