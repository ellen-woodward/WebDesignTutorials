                <h2>Colosseum Rome</h2>
                <p>The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome
                Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre 
                ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world 
                today, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD)
                 in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).
                  Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).
                   The three emperors that were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty,
                    and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: by later classicists 
                    and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius). The Colosseum 
                    is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. The Colosseum 
                    could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history having an 
                    average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles 
                    including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman 
                    mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the 
                    early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a 
                    religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.
